Project-Trello_Quora
Final Code Stub for Quora RESTFUL WEB API with 2 releases.

We developed REST API endpoints of various functionalities required for a website (similar to Quora) from scratch. 
In order to observe the functionality of the endpoints, we used the Swagger user interface and stored the data in the PostgreSQL database. 
Also, the project has been implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).
